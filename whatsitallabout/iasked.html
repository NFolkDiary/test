<PRE>
I asked you for Freedom, for freedom to choose 
But discovered too late it&rsquo;s a word that you use 
To enslave and oppress those who don't share your views 
When you tell them that free men are equal.

I asked you for Justice, for justice I see 
As the triumph of truth with its power to set free, 
But you gave me these laws that are shackling me
And the law says that all men are equal

I asked you for Love, a love that I said
Should remember the wreaths on the graves of the dead
But their flowers are watered by tears that I shed
When you showed me how nations are equal

I asked you for Peace, must peace now depend 
On your right to make war, or the money you spend
On a race that we know to have only one end
As you prove that in death we&rsquo;re all equal

If I ask for Life for this child that I bear
That the sins of his father his children you&rsquo;ll spare
Will you show me a world free from hate and despair?
Will you show me a world without people?
Will you show me a world without people?

</PRE>
