<pre>
Sup whene'er you're thirsty and eat whene'er you will
Roam the hills all over near waters clear and still
Rest whene'er you're weary, then race against the wind
For there's none that has such freedom as the spirit of the hind

The morning sun shafts through the trees and dances on the stream
Skies of blue are welcoming the summer of your dreams
Chains that bind are cast aside and life is all it seems
And the spirit of the hind lives all your dreams

Colours ever changing as the autumn gathers in
Bracken browning in the sun sets all the hills aflame
Poets wander like the clouds that herald in the rain
And the spirit of the hind knows that this time will come again

Snow clad hills stand silent as the frost comes biting in
Frozen streams are waiting for the new life to begin
When warming breezes gather to ease winter's bitter pain
And the spirit of the hind will rise again

Sup whene'er you're thirsty and eat whene'er you will
Roam the hills all over near waters clear and still
Rest whene'er you're weary, then race against the wind
For there's none that has such freedom as the spirit of the hind
Aye there's none that has such freedom as the spirit of the hind


1st verse may be used as chorus
