Now this is an example 
of a sincere and unpretentious CD production by local performers with something to say and a 
solid technique with which to say it, good taste in choosing songs to cover and displaying 
a goodly measure of talent in their own compositions. In this case, &quot;local&quot; currently means 
Leicester, where Pete and Sheila are now based, although Pete&rsquo;s background was in traditional 
singing in the north-east and Sheila&rsquo;s was on the contemporary folk scene in Hastings. The 
duo&rsquo;s own insert note fairly proclaims: &quot;we&rsquo;d like to think the result isn&rsquo;t a compromise, but 
more of a cross-cultural 
exchange&quot;. 
<p>The most familiar material here is Blackwaterside and Dougie MacLean&rsquo;s Ready For 
The Storm, while Sheila and Pete also turn in extremely creditable versions of Lal Waterson&rsquo;s 
cryptic Fine Horseman and the elegiac Davy Steele/John McCusker composition Last Trip Home. 
Barrie Temple&rsquo;s Jacky Frost and Anna McGarrigle&rsquo;s Heart Like A Wheel prove inspired and well 
contrasted choices to open the CD, while Sarah Morgan&rsquo;s Keep You In Peace makes a fitting 
closer. In between, there are two songs by Miggy Campbell (the intriguing Sussex being 
particularly strong, I feel, and a real discovery), and two each by Pete and Sheila 
themselves; I specially liked Sheila's Long Distance Loving, but all four of their songs 
display a keen sense of folk tradition and sensibility. 
<p>Sheila and Pete provide their own 
limited degree of accompaniment, on guitar and concertina/mandocello respectively, though 
a handful of tracks are sung unaccompanied, demonstrating a sensible and plausible approach 
to harmony (a creative collaboration, rather than the jarring conflict implied by the CD&rsquo;s 
title). The couple's thoughtful approach and intrinsic integrity is in evidence throughout 
this attractive CD, which I enjoyed a lot.
