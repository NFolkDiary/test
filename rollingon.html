<pre>
He sings his song and he tells the time of days gone by with the world in rhyme
And he wonders how to hold back time, but the years keep rolling on

He sees some changes for the best but wonders if we need the rest
The greed that politicians bless. It's time they were rolling on

And he sings his song ...

The well groomed look, the TV smiles, entice us with their web of lies
They measure gold not nature's cries. It's time they were rolling on

And he sings ....

The well oiled voice conducts the throng, but the tune is flat and the words are wrong
Go find yourselves another song. It's time to be rolling on

The quiet calm now so hard to find, the selfless love and the peaceful mind
Will these be lost to all our kind. Is it time to be rolling on

Now sing your song just as you please, don't join the rush enjoy the breeze
Hold your own truth and take your ease, let the years go rolling on
Hold your own truth and take your ease, let the years go rolling on
